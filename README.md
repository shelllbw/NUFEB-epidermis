<h1 align="center">NUFEB: Agent-based Simulator for Modelling Cell Populations</h1>


This is the NUFEB repository.

NUFEB (Newcastle University Frontier in Engineering Biology) is an open source tool for 3D agent-based simulation of microbial systems.
The tool is built on top of the molecular dynamic simulator [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov), and extended with features for microbial modelling. 
For more details about NUFEB and its agent-based model, please refer to our [software paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007125).

NUFEB is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License. The development has been funded by the UKâ€™s EPSRC EP/K039083/1 Frontiers in Engineering Biology project.

Online user manual is avaiable at: https://nufeb.readthedocs.io/en/master/

NUFEB requires cmake, git, gcc/g++, openmpi, png-dev and ffmpeg for a successful build.
You can run the following commands to install the packages, 

On Ubuntu:
<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install cmake git-core g++ openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev libpng-dev ffmpeg
</pre>

On CentOS:
<pre>
sudo yum update
sudo yum install cmake git gcc-c++ openmpi openmpi-devel libpng-dev ffmpeg
</pre>

On Windows:

Follow the [tutorial](https://nufeb.readthedocs.io/en/master/install_win.html) to use NUFEB on Windows (via WSL).

### Getting source
