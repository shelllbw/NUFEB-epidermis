Description
""""""""""""""

Perform microbial division to the coccus style atoms (:doc:`atom_style coccus <atom_vec_coccus>`) defined in *group-ID*.
Division occurs when the diameter reaches the
threshold *diameter* value. The cell then divides into two
daughter cells. The total mass of the two daughter cells is always conserved from the
parent cell. One daughter cell is randomly assigned 40% - 60% of the parent
cellâ€™s mass, and the other gets the rest.
Moreover, one daughter cell retains the position of the mother cell,
whereas the other cell is placed on a spherical trajectory around it.

The random *seed* is used for the stochastic operations,
and the random numbers generated by each processor are different.
This means the coordinates of individual atoms will be different when running on different numbers of processors.
*eps_den* represents the density of EPS shell and is used to update the outer_mass and outer_diameter coccus style atoms.

Restrictions
"""""""""""""
This fix is not compatible with the following commands:

* :doc:`atom_style bacillus <atom_vec_bacillus>`
