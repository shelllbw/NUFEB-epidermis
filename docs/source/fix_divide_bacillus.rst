Description
""""""""""""""

Perform microbial division to the bacillus style atoms (:doc:`atom_style bacillus <atom_vec_bacillus>`) defined in *group-ID*.
Division occurs when the bacillus length reaches the threshold value *length*.
If the keyword *normal* is used,
the threshold value is determined by a normal distribution with a mean of *length* and a standard deviation of *normal*.
Upon division, the bacillus cell divides into two daughter cells of equal size.
If the keyword *conserve* is given with a value of *mass*, the total mass of the two daughter cells is conserved.
Otherwise, the total length will be conserved.
After division, the contact point between the two daughter cells is the center of the parent cell.

The random *seed* is used for the stochastic operations,
and the random numbers generated by each processor are different.
This means the division length of individual atoms will be different when running on different numbers of processors.
